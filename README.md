# Introduction
It is a Prompt Sharing Community site that helps users to share prompts and see other people's prompts.
# What was the Problem
Many people use AI chatbots like ChatGPT, but often they do not receive helpful answers because their prompts are not clear or specific enough. 
# How the Problem was solved
To solve this problem, we have created a prompt-sharing site that works similarly to StackOverflow and Reddit. It is a place where people can come and share their prompts or find useful prompts related to any topic, such as technology, cooking, sports, and more.
